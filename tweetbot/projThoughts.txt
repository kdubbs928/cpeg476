Markov Chain Notes & Thoughts:

You generate a table of keys and probabilities. The chain generates new text by randomly starting and moving through the tables.

Steps:
- Parse data and generate tables
	- need to select how big the windows is (ie every n words)
	- Have to mark starting words and ending words
- Use input parameters to assemble new text from the table, moving randomly through it using probabilities

Tweetbot Special Params:
- Cannot use more than 240 characters

Thoughts on how to do that:
- Have program take in 3 command line args (twitter handle, #tokens to use, number of tweets to generate)
- Program uses twitter api to pull the full tweet history, parses it, and then outputs a file with number of desired tweets. Will print the first tweet.  
- Begin with just reading in a text file of tweets and parse them, move onto api after
